# Skydiver Dodge Game

Welcome to **Skydiver Dodge**, my very first Java project! ðŸŽ‰

## About the Game
In this game, you play as a skydiver, falling through the sky while dodging obstacles that come your way. The goal is simple: avoid the obstacles and survive as long as you can!

## Personal Reflection
This project holds a special place for me as it marks the start of my journey into Java programming. It was my first step into coding games, and while itâ€™s far from perfect, itâ€™s a representation of where I began.

Since then, Iâ€™ve grown significantly as a Java developer, learning best practices, design patterns, and how to build more complex and efficient applications. Iâ€™m proud of how far Iâ€™ve come!

## Features
- Simple skydiver mechanics
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses
- Basic collision detection

## Running the Game
Clone the repository and run the game with your favorite IDE or from the command line:

```bash
javac SkydiverDodge.java
java SkydiverDodge
```

## Future Plans
Looking back at this project, there are many things I would approach differently today, but Iâ€™ve left it as is to show my progress over time.
